    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p class="description-text">Korv Stroganoff, or Swedish sausage stroganoff, is a delicious, easy meal that is perfect
        for hurried weeknights and picky eaters. It's also relatively inexpensive and easy to throw
        together with pantry staples. If you're in Sweden, falukorv is the obvious choice, but for those
        in other countries, hot dogs or un-sliced bologna (or any mild sausage) works fabulously as well. 
        Serve with rice, pasta, or potatoes (or even roasted cauliflower for a low-carb twist), parsley on top,
        and sliced raw veggies on the side!
