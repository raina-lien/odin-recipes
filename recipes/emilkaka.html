   <h3>Description</h3>
   <p>I was craving buttercream, my husband was craving a light, fluffy
    cake. My first thought was to make a traditional Swedish chocolate coffee
    cake known as "KÃ¤rleksmums;" but of course, we were out of cocoa powder.
    Another option was a delicious "Sylviakaka," which required up to six eggs
    depending on which recipe one chose; we only had a few eggs and I wanted
    to save two for breakfast. So, it seemed, I had no choice but to create
    my own cake. And thus Emilkaka, or Emil's cake- named for my husband
    who said it was the best cake he's ever had- was born. A fluffy, 
    vanilla-y, super sweet, utterly decadent cake best enjoyed with a cup
    of coffee. Enjoy!
