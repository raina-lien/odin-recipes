This project is a simple recipe website created in HTML. This website will include a homepage with a title and links to various recipes; each recipe will include a picture of the recipe and instructions. By undertaking and completing this project, I will show mastery of basic HTML skills, including creating titles, headers, and paragraphs, using bold and italic text for both semantic and non-semantic purposes, as well as inserting functioning links (both external and internal) and images.
